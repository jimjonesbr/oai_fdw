oai_fdw 1.9
2024-02-06

 * Bug Fixes *
   - This fix a fixed string length limit in the support functions (512 bytes). I
     mistakenly assumed that it was defined like that in the OAI-PMH Standard.

oai_fdw 1.8
2023-11-15

 * Performance improvements
   -  This intoduces a new pagination logic to go through the result
      sets from OAI requests. It no longer iterates over the xml document
      to retrieve the OAI records for building the tuples. Instead, it
      now parses all records from a result set into a list right after
      loading the xml response, so that they can accessed later on for
      building the tuples.

oai_fdw 1.7
2023-09-22

 * New Features *
   -  Adds PostgreSQL 16 support

oai_fdw 1.6
2023-04-11

 * New Features *
   -  Adds `request_redirect` and `request_max_redirect` options (CREATE SERVER).
      This allows users to enable or disable URL redirects issued by the server
      and also how many times a redirection may occur in a single http request.

 * Bug Fixes *
   - This bug fix implements a http response validation to avoid a server crash
     when a support function receives an invalid OAI document from the repository.

oai_fdw 1.5.1
2023-04-11

 * Bug Fixes *
   - This bug fix implements a http response validation to avoid a server crash
     when a support function receives an invalid OAI document from the repository.

 * New Features *
   - Proxy support for HTTP requests (CREATE SERVER).
   - Connection timeout option for HTTP requests (CREATE SERVER).
     
 * Bug Fixes *
   - cURL exception handling: Adds missing cURL error message and response code in case of failed http 
    requests. In previous versions these values were never fetched.
 
 * Enhancements *
   - URL validator no longer checks if the URL is reachable. It now only checks the URL's syntax.
   - URls with protocols other than HTTP and HTTPS are now rejected before execution, as other
     protocols are not supported in the OAI-PMH Standard.
